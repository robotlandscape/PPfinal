Procedural Programing capstone project for VLACS.

## Scenario: 2
> HumanaTECH is a technology startup with one mission: bringing life-saving technology to people living in remote parts of the world. This past year, their startup received a lot of media attention, raised a lot of fundraising dollars, and put in place a board of directors that must approve every project. In the past, the HumanaTECH team would choose locations to help by drawing them out of a hat. However, this year the board is watching, and it wants to ensure that the funds are being maximized to help the most people possible. The board has hired a team of programmers to help it make the best decision using hard data.

This project seems like it could use the most help from a team of programmers in comparison to the other two scenarios. I see this project as having the greatest real-life relevance, and out of the three scenarios, this is the one I would actually consult with a software company to help fix. 

## Researching Q&A's

### How could data aid a location-based decision?
Let's say the problem that HumanaTECH was trying to solve was hunger, and that its solution was to import rice into the affected countries (almost in a [freerice](https://www.freerice.com) type manner). Because we're given finite resources, we cannot stop hunger complete, at least as a single organization. Given this, we have to work smart to decide where our resources can best be utilized. 

### What kinds of things are important to think about as far as location?
Data like under-nourished population, *percent* of that population compared to the rest of the country, and the primary causes of malnourishment (is it a drought, or a war? We can alleviate a famine but can't stop a war), are all valuable data to have. That, and what the trend may be would be helpful too: if a country is currently having issues but is getting better, that may be a reason to not put as many resources there. Different types of resources we would have access to might be put in strategic locations, for example if a country was well fed but poorly educated, we might send teachers there, or vice versa with food. 

### What's the best way to collect decision-making data?
There are organizations which do collect valuable data on world hunger, like the [World Food Programme](wfp.org), who have detailed reports on a per-country level on which countries are at greatest peril, especially in the context of impending famines or conflict. 

## Reflection

> What did you discover through your research that was new or surprising? If you didn't discover anything new, why not?
In my visiting the WFP website, I learned about the multifacetedness of eliminating and preventing famine. There's education, there's political stability, there's economic equality, and international dependence, all of which play into creating contitions ripe for disaster. 

> Was it difficult to research this information? Why or why not?
I already knew about freerice, that provided a good starting place for my research. I just had to look at what the organization that owned freerice was, which was the WFP. The WHO is going to be another useful source as well.

> Is it important to be able to perform good research as a programmer? Why or why not?
Yes! One *must* have a solid understanding of the problem they're trying to solve before solving it, knowing the restraints of a project is a prerequisite for any engineering-based project.
