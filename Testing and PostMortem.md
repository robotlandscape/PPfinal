Acceptance Testing
==================

## Spell Check
No change needed 

## Capitalization Check
No change needed 

## Punctuation Check (parentheses, quotes, etc.)
Cleared punctuation in a comment but otherwise good

## Spacing and Indentation Check
Made the main menu a bit nicer

Usability Testing
=================

## User Input Check (i.e. running your program using a variety of user input responses)
Output was as expected, it brought the user back and asked them to try again. Doing control-c could be nicer, because at the moment it just throws an error, but it exits the program fine. 

## Peer Review (i.e. receiving feedback from another person)

Post Mortem Review Questions
============================

## What was the purpose of your program?
The purpose of the program was to sort 

## How could your program be useful in the real world?
## What is a problem you ran into, and how did you fix it?
## Describe one thing you would do differently the next time you write a program.
## How could your program be generalized and useful in other areas?

Security Measure
================

## Authentication
## Digital Signature
## Encryption
